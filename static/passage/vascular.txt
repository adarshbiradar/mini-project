Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. They are caused by Vascular Malformations
Treatment -
Medication: Patients may be placed on medications such as oral corticosteroids like prednisone or an oral blood pressure medication called propranolol, in order to help slow the rapid growth phase and promote involutionSurgery: The surgical treatment of hemangiomas must carefully balance the need for early treatment with the scarring that will be created by the procedure. Because most lesions undergo at least a fair amount of involution on their own, it is important to delay most surgery until this occurs to allow tissue to stabilize before reconstruction. The treatment may include Laser Therapy.
Laser Therapy: Finally, laser therapy can be used to treat ulcerated lesions, as well as any residual blood vessels or discoloration that may remain after involution. Extensive airway lesions may also require CO2 laser therapy for management, which is carried out by an otolaryngologist (ENT surgeon) under anesthesia.
Sclerotherapy: Sclerotherapy involves injection of a chemical sclerosant into the venous channels of the lesion to cause inflammation and eventual shutdown of the vessels with shrinkage of the VM. This is usually performed by an interventional radiologist under anesthesia using guidance from ultrasound, X-ray, or MRI.
