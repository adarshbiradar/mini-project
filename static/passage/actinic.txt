Actinic keratosis (AK) is a UV lightâ€“induced lesion of the skin that may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is by far the most common lesion with malignant potential to arise on the skin.
Diet One study has suggested that a low-fat diet in humans leads to greater resolution of existent actinic keratoses and the development of fewer new ones during the study period. Activity
Instruct patients to practice sun safety, such as the use of sunscreen and protective clothing, and to limit outdoor activity from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. Prevention includes the development of these lesions is directly proportional to sun exposure. Actinic keratoses can be reduced or delayed by using sunscreens and reducing sun exposure. Patients should limit recreational exposure, and those who work outdoors should consider making adjustments in their work-related sun exposure. For patients forced to undergo sun exposure, recommend applying a sunscreen of sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or more and wearing protective clothing daily. Long-Term Monitoring If the lesions do not respond to topical therapy, they can be treated with cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen spray for 5-20 seconds. Lesions become irritated and ulcerate, and eventually the diseased pathology is sloughed from healthy skin. A biopsy of more advanced lesions that are indurated should be performed to rule out an invasive carcinoma. the medications include Fluorouracil cream (Carac, Fluoroplex, Efudex),Imiquimod cream (Aldara, Zyclara),Ingenol mebutate gel (Picato),Diclofenac gel
